            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>Energy drinks and their packaging are found on the shelves of convenience stores and supermarkets. They are easily accessible and sometimes part of someone’s daily routine. People drink energy drinks for multiple reasons: they like the taste, need a booster to finish an assignment they procrastinated on, or buy it because they were drawn to the packaging. The third reason I listed is precisely why I am doing my project on this topic. Packaging design is crucial to any company, as  it is part of what gets consumers to buy their products.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This genre addresses the effectiveness of marketing. The bright colors, bold font choices, and text on the cans all contribute to consumers' likeliness of picking a certain brand of energy drink over others on the shelves.</p>

            <h2>WHEN IS IT USED?</h2>
            <p>This genre is used for branding and marketing energy drinks. The market is overflowing with energy drink brands, and the way they decide to brand their drink helps certain companies stand out from others. The goal is to entice audiences to buy the product. More products bought equals more revenue. All of these marketing tactics are a result of capitalism.</p>
            <h2>WHY IS BRANDING IMPORTANT?</h2>
            <p>Branding is pivotal to marketing for a company. The brand identity is how consumers' recall a product and establishes itself in the market. The elements of graphics, color, font choice, and written content all contribute to its uniqueness. I specifically zoned in on energy drink branding because it has a quality that is different from other types of drinks (soft, sparkling, water etc,.).</p>
            <h2>WHO IS IT FOR?</h2>
            <p>The people that associate with this genre would usually be teens to mid-20s. Younger children should stay away from caffeine, so they are not included in the range. The older generation isn’t too keen on sugary substances, and usually goes for coffee when they want to ingest caffeine products. One study revealed that the amount of caffeine being consumed was 227 milligrams per day among young adults ages 20 through 39, compared to their non-consumer counterparts, who only consumed about 52.1 milligrams of caffeine per day.

            <h2>CONTENT</h2>
            <h3>Logo Design</h3>
            <p>In this new age of modernity, many brands seem to benefit from simplistic and sleek designs, but energy drinks stray away from this concept. In contrast to most companies using one or two colors, energy drink brands incorporates a myriad in order to stand out.</p> <br>
                <img id="redbull" src="images/rb.jpg" alt="redbull" width="300px" height="300px"> <figcaption>Red Bull Logo, 1987</figcaption>
                <br> 
                <p>A great example to analyze is the infamous Red Bull logo, the striking red and yellow logo has established istelf as one of the most popular energy drinks on the market. Instead of being minimalistic, the eccentric graphic design is what makes the brand relevant and stand out amongst its competitors. The Red Bull logo also customized its font, making it uniquely theirs. This can be seen by the letters "R" and "B". The logo may not be classy and dainty, but it is bold and powerful, which is exactly the type of messaging energy drinks make an effort to exhibit.  </p>
            <h3>Graphics</h3>
                <p>Funky graphics and bold color choices are a staple to most energy drink brands. Bang Energy Drink is the perfect example to use in terms of graphics.</p> <br>
                <img src="images/bang.jpg" alt="bang" width="300px" height="215px"> <figcaption>Bang Energy Drink, 2012</figcaption> <br>
                <p>Bang energy drink has a different color palette for every flavor they produce, as seen in the graphic above. Smashbrand.com points out that Bang Energy "adopted the concept of taking adult drink packaging and evoking memories from our childhood." This is seen through the playful use of color. The combinations are quite contrasting, like the red and green or the blue and pink. The dichotomy gives it a sense of childlike wonderment.</p>
            <h3>Messaging</h3> 
            <p>The type of content on energy drink cans usually include nutritional facts, and dietary/health warnings, and a couple short paragraphs that talk about the drinks’ conception and ingredients used. I will use Guayaki Yerba Mate as an example for messaging</p><br>
            <img src="images/yerb.jpg" alt="yerba" width="300px" height="300px"><br> <figcaption>Guayaki Yerba Mate, 1996</figcaption>
            <p>Aside from the positives, the companies also need to be transparent about the many health risks associated with energy drinks as well.</p>
